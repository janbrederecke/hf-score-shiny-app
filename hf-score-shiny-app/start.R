    <br>
    Biomarkers are considered as tools to enhance cardiovascular risk estimation.
    However, the value of biomarkers on risk estimation beyond established risk scores,
    their comparative impact among different European regions and their role in the drive
    towards individualized medicine remains uncertain. Within BiomarCaRE we use our unique
    resources and an established infrastructure to collaboratively assess the predictive
    value biomarkers in an interdisciplinary approach. A large panel of biomarkers
    including established protein-based markers such as NTproBNP and troponin as well
    as emerging biomarkers such as Omics markers is assessed to improved disease
    prediction among different European populations. Collaborations with world-class
    clinical trial investigators add data on the interaction of the BiomarCaRE panel
    with risk-lowering medication, lifestyle changes and opens the way for individualized
    approaches. Moreover, cost-effectiveness analyses adds to the clinical evaluation
    of the BiomarCaRE panel. Thereby, BiomarCaRE is unique in terms of its dimension,
    targeting of novel biomarkers, and the evaluation of the impact of a multiple
    biomarker score in large prospective population cohorts across different European regions."
